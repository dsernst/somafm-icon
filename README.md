Tweaks the icon for SomaFM

SomaFM is amazing. The perfect radio station for 24 hours a day. For hanging out, or getting work done.

This is an attempt to tweak the iOS app's icon.

Here's the old icon:

The look is retro and alternative, which is endearing in a sort of way. It matches the station's brand.

One issue is the `S` is just too large. It looks unbalanced, and stands out a bit too much.

Here's the same icon, with an `S` that fits a bit better:

Not a big change. You can see them side by side (or overlaidâ€” check out Onion Skin diffing mode) here: https://github.com/dsernst/somafm-icon/commit/9d891e39cf329892d0262b51fb9971900137e0f3
